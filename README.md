# Discord Channel Management Bot

## What Does the Bot Do?

This Discord bot empowers your members by allowing them to create and manage their own channels. The creator of a channel will have permissions to manage it, including pinning messages and changing the channel name. If a channel becomes inactive for a configurable period, the bot will archive it. If the channel remains inactive even after being archived, the bot will delete it. Reactivating the channel will restore it to its original category.

### Key Commands:

- `/set_config` - Set the bot's configuration settings.
- `/create` - Create a channel that the creator can manage.
