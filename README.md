# WHAT DOES THE BOT DO?

A discord bot that lets your members create a channel and whoever creates has permissions to manage it as well (pin message , change name etc)
If the channel gets inactive for a certain time you can configure, the bot will archive the channel. If it remains inactive even after archiving it'll delete the channel. Making the channel active will restore it to the original category.

/set_config = set the configuration
/create = create a channel that creator can manage
